# Potato-Leaf-Disease-Detection-Using-Image-Processing-and-Neural-Networks
• A CNN model was assembled and trained to classify photographs of different types of leaves and identify the diseases which infected the leaves • The model was tested for a dataset of almost 60000 leaf images • It was measured how the accuracy depends on the number of epochs in order to detect potential overfitting problem.
